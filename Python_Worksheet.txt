Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
ANS: list- List is one of the most versatile collection object types available in Python. A list is a mutable, ordered sequence of items. as such, it can be indexed, sliced, and changed. Each element can be accessed using its positionin the list.
We cannot use a list as a key for a dictionary.
Tuple-Tuples are used to hold together multiple objects.Tuples are immutable like strings i.e. we can not modify tuples.
We can use tuple as a key for a dictionary.
Set-A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique and must be immutable.
Dictionary-A dictionary is a key:value pair, similar to an associative array found in other programming languages. In dictionary the key must be unique.


12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô
with space in python.
ANS: Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.
	"I"+" Love "+"India"

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.
ANS:
The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
For example, ord(‚Äòa‚Äô) returns the integer 97, ord(‚Äò‚Ç¨‚Äô) (Euro sign) returns 8364. This is the inverse of chr() for 8-bit strings and of unichr() for unicode objects. 
In the following example we are finding the unicode code point values of an integer, a character and a special character. The first 128 unicode code points are same as ASCII values which means the unicode code points are same as the ASCII values of these passed strings of length 1.
INPUT:
# unicode code point of integer
print("The ASCII value of 9 is",ord('9'))

# unicode code point of alphabet
print("The ASCII value of B is",ord('B'))

# unicode code point of special character
print("The ASCII value of ! is",ord('!'))

OUTPUT:
The ASCII value of 9 is 57
The ASCII value of B is 66
The ASCII value of ! is 33

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.


14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ùëéùë•2 + ùëèùë• + ùëê = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‚Äòa‚Äô should not be equal to 0.

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‚Äòn‚Äô natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‚Äòn‚Äô.
